    * Version 0.4.1 released.
    * pythermalzone.py is now checking for every dir in the
      /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/ directory. If the temperature
      file is found, then its value is read.
      This should fix a bug that prevented cpuspeedy to get
      the cpu's temperature in those systems where the path
      to the temperature file is not /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM
      Thanks to Nathaniel McCallum <npmccallum@gentoo.org>.
